Integrating Machine Learning and Genetic Expression Programming for Enhanced Punching Shear Strength Prediction

# **Overview**

The research investigates the punching shear strength of reinforced concrete (RC) flat slabs using advanced data-driven methods, including:

Machine Learning (ML): Linear Regression, SGD, Ridge, Decision Trees, KNN, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost

Deep Learning (DL): Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

Symbolic Modeling: Genetic Expression Programming (GEP)

This project demonstrates how integrating ML and GEP can provide more accurate and interpretable tools for structural design, potentially informing future updates to design codes.

# **Contents**

Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for model training, tuning, and evaluation.

Data: Preprocessed experimental dataset.

Models: Scripts and saved models for ML, DL, and GEP.

Results: Performance plots, SHAP analysis, and equation derivations.

# **Requirements**

Python version: Python 3.8 or higher

IDE: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or any Python IDE

# **License**
